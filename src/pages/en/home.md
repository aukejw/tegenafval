title: Amsterdam tegen afval

## Amsterdam is turning into a garbage dump.

Blaming deposit hunters or the municipality will not solve the problem.

Fortunately, it's easy to contribute to a cleaner city:

<div class="logo-row">
    <div class="logo-image-container">
        <img src="/images/2025-07-08_nexttothebin.svg" alt="Place cans and bottles next to the bin">
        <span class="img-caption">Leave bottles and cans <strong>next to</strong> the bin.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="logo-image-container">
        <img src="/images/2025-07-08_bringitback.svg" alt="Bring cans and bottles back yourself">
        <span class="img-caption">Return bottles and cans yourself.</span>
    </div>
</div>

No bottles or cans in the waste bin? No reason to open it.

Want the municipality to do more? [We agree](/en/gemeente)!
