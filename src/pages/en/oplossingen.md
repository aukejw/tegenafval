title: What can I do? - Amsterdam tegen afval

## What can I do?

- See someone littering? Say something.

- Talk to your neighbors if they put out bulky waste (grofvuil) on the wrong day or in the wrong place. Refer them to [amsterdam-afval.nl](https://amsterdam-afval.nl/) (Dutch).

- [Borrow a litter picker from the municipality](https://www.amsterdam.nl/afval/leen-afvalgrijper-afvalring/), or [buy your own litter picker](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/l/grijpers/30657/). Keep your street clean. Ask your neighbors to join in.

- Join one of the local initiatives in the city: 
  [Trashy Friends Club (Instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/trashyfriendsclub/), 
  [Vuilnis oproer Nieuw-West](https://www.vuilnisoproer.nl/vuilnisoproer), 
  [Amsterdam Cleanup Day](https://www.amsterdamcleanupday.com/).

- [Adopt one of the approximately 15,000 waste containers](https://www.amsterdam.nl/afval/adopteer-afvalcontainer/#dit-doet-een-containeradoptant). 
  Almost one third are already adopted! You can do this together with your neighbors.

- Report illegally placed waste or full containers, for example via the 
  [Amsterdam app](https://www.amsterdam.nl/contact/amsterdam-app/) or 
  [this site](https://meldingen.amsterdam.nl/incident/beschrijf). 
  Even if the municipality is slow to respond: if itâ€™s not reported, nothing will happen.

- Download the 
  [Plastic Avengers app](https://www.plasticsoupsurfer.org/nl/campagnes/the-plastic-avengers-app/) and help with crowd-sourced research on street litter.

There are [countless other ideas](https://www.parool.nl/columns-opinie/lezers-over-opengebroken-prullenbakken-in-amsterdam-in-berlijn-en-kopenhagen-is-deze-oplossing-al-heel-normaal~b93cef88/), but these sometimes require investment from the municipality or new rules about deposits and waste.

These options are about what *you* can do.
