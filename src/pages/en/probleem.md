## Why do I see so much litter on the street?

In the center of Amsterdam, garbage bags are collected from the street. 
These bags are [often torn open before they are collected](https://www.at5.nl/nieuws/232360/bedrijven-mogen-afval-niet-meer-in-plastic-zakken-op-straat-zetten).

Additionally, public waste bins are opened by 
"[deposit hunters](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/van-daklozen-tot-georganiseerde-teams-de-jacht-op-statiegeld-ontregelt-amsterdam~bd981ec3/)"
looking for bottles and cans.

A crowd-sourced sample by 
[Dirk de Groot (a.k.a. zwerfinator)](https://www.zwerfinator.nl/) and 
[Merijn Tinga](https://www.plasticsoupsurfer.org/) in November 2024 showed the following for Amsterdam:

- 20% of public bins were open or broken.
- The national average is only 5%.
- In smaller cities, this is a non-issue.

We do not have comparable data from *before* the deposit scheme. But it's clear that a few years ago, we saw less litter on the street.

This is a shame, because the deposit scheme does have an effect. Since its introduction, the number of bottles and cans in street litter has dropped by about 70%

## Why does the deposit scheme work in Germany?

In Germany, the introduction of a deposit on plastic bottles and cans did not lead to noticeably more litter on the streets.

A few important differences:

1. The Netherlands lags far behind in waste separation. Only [77% of plastic is currently returned](https://www.statiegeldnederland.nl/gm-files/update-voortgang-en-resultaten-statiegeld-in-nederland-cijfers-2024.pdf), compared to 98% in Germany.

2. Deposit collection in the Netherlands is often not well organized. Deposit machines are [often broken](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/een-jaar-na-de-invoering-van-statiegeld-op-blikjes-zuchtend-in-ellenlange-rijen-en-langs-omgekieperde-vuilnisbakken~bad34c0a/). This does not motivate people to return bottles and cans, and it [indirectly costs consumers money](https://zwerfinator.nl/index.php/blik-op-stuk/). This is better organized in Germany [[NOS](https://nos.nl/artikel/2527333-niemand-voorzag-de-zooi-op-straat-door-uitbreiding-van-statiegeld)].

3. The deposit in Germany is higher: 25 cents per can compared to 10 cents in the Netherlands. This provides extra motivation to return "pfand".

In any case, we can learn from Germany, where "[Pfand geh√∂rt daneben](https://www.pfand-gehoert-daneben.de/)" is already well-known.
